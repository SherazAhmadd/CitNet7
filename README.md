# CitNet7 â€“ A Deep Learning Based Diagnostic Architecture for Citrus Plant Diseases

CitNet7 is a deep learning model that employs a lightweight deep convolutional neural network architecture to diagnose citrus diseases, such as canker, leaf miner, and greening (HLB). This capability can significantly reduce damage in citrus orchards and assist farmers in producing higher-quality fruit.

## How to Use


Visit  - [CitNet7-Webpage](https://citnet7-2025.streamlit.app/)

  - Access the Online Webpage through Link and navigate the disease detection page
  - Upload an image of citrus plant leave on Webpage
  - DCNN algorithm will diagnose the disease and show the recommended results

    
## Deployment

For using pre-trained CitNet7

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SherazAhmadd/CitNet7.git
```
```
  use CitNet7.h5 model
```



## Usage/Examples
